In my capacity as an electrical engineer, I have extensively utilized MATLAB for simulations and analyses throughout my academic program. However, recognizing the potential benefits of Python, it is crucial for us to be proficient in using Python for similar purposes as well.

The aim of this tutorial is to provide a foundational understanding of Python to undergraduate engineering students in their first and second year, who may not be familiar with the language. The tutorial starts from the basics and progressively introduces the students to the numerical solutions and simulations using Python.

This tutorial is based on a course called "Numerical Solution and Simulation in Engineering with MATLAB" taught by Dr. Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney.

The tutorial is organized into the following chapters:
Chapter 1: Python Installation
Chapter 2: Introduction to Python (variables, operations, arrays, polynomials, plots, etc.)
Chapter 3: Basics of Programming in Python (Functions and Control Flow)
Chapter 4: Numerical Methods (Numerical approximation, optimization, and system of linear equations)
Chapter 5: Advanced Numerical Methods for System of Linear Equations (SVD, Linear Programming)
Chapter 6: Probability, Statistics, and Data Analysis
Chapter 7: Symbolic Mathematics and Nonlinear Equations
Chapter 8: System of Nonlinear Equations (Root Finding, Newton-Raphson, etc.)
